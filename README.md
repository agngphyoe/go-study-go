What's the Name? Go or Golang?
  You might hear the language called both Go and Golang, which might be confusing. I once thought they were names for different languages. But Golang is just another name for Go – and Go remains the official name. Golang came from the domain name of the Go official website, golang.org. Which is actually really helpful, because “Golang” is much more searchable than "Go" on Google. So it makes life a little easier for those who might be looking for information on the programming language.
